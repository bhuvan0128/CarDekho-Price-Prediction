# CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the price of used cars based on their features. The project uses historical data from CarDekho.com to provide actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and the used car market in India.

## Objectives
- Build an accurate machine learning model to predict used car prices.
- Enhance pricing transparency and market efficiency.

## Benefits
- **For Sellers**: Better pricing strategies for faster sales and higher profits.
- **For Buyers**: Access to competitively priced vehicles.
- **For the Market**: Improved efficiency and transparency in the used car market.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WtxKHx5uQoFYmAEKNWs0Jdx4jkS-OXDq/view?usp=sharing

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots.
   - Bivariate analysis with scatter plots and correlation matrices.
   - Multivariate analysis using pair plots and regression plots.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling and outlier removal.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Regression-based machine learning model.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
